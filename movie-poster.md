# Movie Poster Steps

## Step 1: Creative Brief
*(Commit message: "Completed creative brief")*

Before you open any AI tools, plan your vision. This is your anchor—return to it after every AI generation.

**Your Movie Choice:   
- **Movie Title: Six of Crows
- **Why I chose this movie: I chose this movie because the characters are so interesting, even if the plot is kind of weak.

**Core Emotion:**  
What ONE feeling should a viewer get from your poster? (Examples: wonder, fear, joy, excitement, mystery, tension, nostalgia)  
- **Core emotion: Confidence in the eye of doom  

**Essential Visual Element:**  
What ONE image, object, or visual MUST appear on your poster?  
- **Essential element: Crows  
- **Why this element: They call themselves the six of crows, and crows symbolize death, which is something the characters are all familiar with.

**What NOT to Include:**  
What do you definitely NOT want? (This helps you evaluate AI outputs critically.)  
- **Avoid: Don't put them in the ice court yet.  

**Color Palette:**  
- **Dominant color(s): Black  
- **Accent color(s): Snow-white 
- **Overall mood:** A black and white poster old themed poster 

**Composition:**  
- [ ] Close-up (face/detail)  
- [ ] Wide shot (landscape/setting)  
- [ ] Medium shot (full figure)  
- [ ] Object/symbol centered  
- [x] Character collage  

- **Focal point description: I want the focus to be on Kaz Brekker, who is the main character.

## Step 2: AI Generation – First Attempts
*(Commit message: "Documented first two AI attempts")*

Open Adobe Firefly. Generate images based on your creative brief, but remember: you're exploring possibilities, not looking for a final answer.

**Attempt 1:**  
- **My prompt: The characters from the Six of Crows are in the middle, (Kaz, Inej, Jesper, Matthias, Nina, and Wylan) make all of them look young. Add crows flying around. There seems to be chaos going on around them. 

- **What worked: It did exactly as it was told to do  
- **What didn't work: The characters do not look accurate to themselves in the book, and there is a random lightning bolt  
- **What I'll change for next attempt: I will add more descriptors of the characters  

**Attempt 2:**  
- **My prompt: Create the 6 main characters from six of crows. Kaz Brekker is in the middle, wearing a nice vest and a cane in his hand. To his right is Inej, she is small, brown-skinned, and has daggers clearly sticking out from her belt. To Kaz's left is Jesper, he is tall and lanky, and is wearing two guns on his belt. To the right of Inej is Nina, who is rounder, and have her hands in front of her doing something fancy. To the left of Jesper is Matthias, who is huge and blond, and wearing a big fur coat. To Matthias's left is Wylan, who has a sack of potions spilling out of his bag, and has nerdy goggles on his head.

 

- **What worked:The descriptors made the characters look more similar to them in real life.  
- **What didn't work: Jesper looks like a cowboy for some reason.  
- **What I'll change for next attempt: I am going to focus on the background more.

## Step 3: AI Generation – Continued Iteration
*(Commit message: "Documented final AI attempts")*

Keep refining. Try at least two more meaningfully different directions.

**Attempt 3:**  
- **My prompt:Create a background of a tall, black bar with the lights shining through the window. It has a rickety gate that Says the crow club, with a crow sitting on the gate. Next to it is a  neon green bar, with crows sitting on the top of it.  

- **What worked: The crow club was accurate  
- **What didn't work:The second bar is neon, and not an actual building, and the crows are out of proportion.  
- **What I'll change for next attempt:I'll take out the second bar, as it is not super important to the story.  

**Attempt 4:**  
- **My prompt:Create the 6 main characters from six of crows. Kaz Brekker is in the middle, wearing a nice vest and a cane in his hand, and wearing black gloves. To his right is Inej, she is small, brown-skinned, and has daggers clearly sticking out from her belt. To Kaz's left is Jesper, he is tall and lanky, and is wearing two guns on his belt. He is wearing a black and beige coat, and no hat. He is also darker skinned, with dark brown hair. To the right of Inej is Nina, who is rounder, and have her hands in front of her doing something fancy. She does not have any weapons. To the left of Jesper is Matthias, who is huge and blond, and wearing a fur coat over his shoulders. To Matthias's left is Wylan, who has a sack of potions spilling out of his bag, and has nerdy goggles on his head. Add crows flying around. There seems to be chaos going on around them.  

- **What worked: 5 of the characters looked great  
- **What didn't work: They forgot about Nina.  

**Final AI Image Selected:** (Which attempt? Why?) Number 2 because the 4 characters that were there looked accurate, and the title was in the photo.

## Step 4: Photoshop Modifications
*(Commit message: "Added Photoshop modifications")*

Export your best AI generation and open it in Photoshop. You must make at least TWO intentional modifications. The AI gave you raw material—now make it yours.

**Modification Ideas:**
- Crop or reframe the image  
- Adjust colors, contrast, or brightness  
- Add the movie title (typography matters!)  
- Add a tagline  
- Combine elements from multiple AI generations  
- Remove unwanted elements  

**Your Modifications:**  
1.  
2.  
3. (optional)  

**Save your final poster as:** `final-poster.jpg` or `final-poster.png`  
**Drag your final poster file into your GitHub repo folder before committing.**

## Step 5: Reflection
*(Commit message: "Completed reflection")*

**How did your vision evolve?**  
Compare your original creative brief to your final poster. What changed? What stayed the same?  


**What decision are you most proud of that the AI didn't make for you?**  


**What would you do differently next time?**
